# AR_Vtuber 
The goal for this project is to create an artificial intelligence powered VTuber. This topic is of interest due to the rising interest in influencer based forms of entertainment in recent years, as well as considerable improvements in AI and AR technologies. This project focuses on using AI and AR to develop an AI powered VTuber that will act as a virtual companion for users, bridging the gap between the virtual world and the real world.

There will be three main parts to this project. The first part will involve using AI and a text-to-speech
API to create a program that can run on a loop, and generate interesting ‘stream of
consciousness’ style statements (to imitate the behavior of a human livestreamer). This program
will also need to integrate with peripherals to interact with the real world (e.g. reading live chat
messages). And finally, there will need to be some sort of visual aspect to the program that can
create an avatar that can listen to the audio generated by the main program, and adjust its facial
expressions accordingly, as well as to display relevant gestures based on the context.
